# Introduction
- The basic premise of this presentation is that, even if the products are not fully baked from a security perspective, as long as they are stable, they are enormously better than what you are doing right now.
- We have not put these products through there paces from a security perspective. We have evaluated the security of the products from the perspective of workflow and operations:
  - does the product encourage or even require a workflow that is an improvement over most dev organizations
  - is the product sufficiently easy to use that people won't work around it

# SCM-based Stratgies
- Put your encrypted files in a separate repo

# Standards for evaluation
- Started by looking for products that solve the problem all the way into the cloud and the data-center, not just inside the development org. That means a product with strong auditibility in a git repo still might be rated "poor" if you have no capability to monitor what happens after the secret is deployed.
