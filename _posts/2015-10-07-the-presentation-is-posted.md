OWASP has posted the presentation from [Turtles All the Way Down: Storing Secrets in the Cloud and in the Data Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUSvv2maMYI) from [AppSec USA](http://appsecusa2015.sched.org/event/621130a7c1090d129134ab6fb1c3cba4), on youtube. Now you can see the slide deck and listen my mellifluous voice, as I talk about secret stores.
