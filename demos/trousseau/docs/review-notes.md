# Trousseau

## Summary
Trousseau is similar to git-crypt and blackbox but relies on an external data file. Like the others, you can define recipients who are able to read the data. Trousseau is fundamentally an GPG encrypted key-value store. Unlike the others, Trousseau assumes you have a canonical store, then you push and pull to remote storage where the data is accessed by others.

I wouldn't recommend using it because there are other products with similar models that are less fussy to use.
