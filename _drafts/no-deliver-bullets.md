title: Working on the AppSec USA "Turtles" Presentation
---
I've spent most of the day working on my AppSec USA Presentation. One of the biggest challenges I find in a presentation like this is balancing the desire people have for definitive answers with the fact that every organization and every application is unique. There are rarely, if ever, silver bullets. I'd love to be able to say, "all you have to do is THIS, and you'll be secure", but of course, it simply doesn't work that way.

So my audience will have to be satisfied with some strategies and some wisdom from the trenches. Some of it will apply to them, some will not.
